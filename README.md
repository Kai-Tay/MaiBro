## Week 10 - Deployment
<ul>
  <li>Attempted to use Firebase App Hosting -> Did not work/Does not know how it works so we ditched it :/</li>
  <li>Tried out using Docker -> Worked really well and learnt how to use Docker, tried to deploy the docker container on AWS EC2</li>
  <li>Attempted to deploy on AWS EC2 -> Didnt work out that well as we require the site to be HTTPS secured but we did not have a paid IP addres to allow us to do so.</li>
  <li> Resorted to using onRender for deployment -> Quick and simple allowed us to get everything running in minutes with Github and Docker</li>
</ul>
